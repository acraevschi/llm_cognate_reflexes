1) How to extract Glottotrees from Glottolog for each language folder in lexibank
2) Write a function that will take forms and tree, and pack it nicely into prompt. The function should remove some percent of forms from input and only keep it for output. 
For now, get rid of very sparse concepts.
3) Generate a list of possible sound changes (along with their frequency of occurence). Take from one of the two: https://chridd.nfshost.com/diachronica/ https://diadm.ddl.cnrs.fr/unidia/index.php  
4) For future: write a function that will generate a random tree of some number of taxa. After that, randomly generate some proto-forms (plausible ones in terms of phonotactics). 
Sample sound changes in accordance with their frequency from (3) and apply it going down the tree. Then, remove proto-forms and intermediate forms and only keep them in labels. 
Apply some noise in random places (metathesis, not applying sound change in individual forms, some other things maybe)
5) Make the model reconstruct it.

1) Prompt + data_prompt
2) Tokenize (1). 
3) Tokenize output
4) Create a copy of (2) but full of -100. Concat that and (3). This will be "labels".

After that:
```
data_collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    mlm=False,
    pad_to_multiple_of=8
)

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,
    gradient_accumulation_steps=2,
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    fp16=True,
    logging_steps=10,
    save_strategy="no",
    report_to="none"
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=dataset,
    data_collator=data_collator,
)

trainer.train()
```

But check how to use LoRA and see what data_collator does.
